## Unconstrained ordination

**What does it mean?**

* First we look for major variation, then try to attribute it to environmental variation
* vs. constrained ordination, where we only want to see what can be explained by environmental variables of interest

**Types of unconstrained ordination:**

* Principal Components Analysis - PCA
* Nonmetric Multidimensional Scaling - NMDS
